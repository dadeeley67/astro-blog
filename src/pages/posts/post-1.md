# hey girl, heeeeeey!

Published on: 2024-01-09

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts. 
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new '.astro' files and palcing them in the 'src/page/' folder. 
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
